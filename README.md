This project is a temperature sensor that will trigger an alert message if temperature exceeds a set value 30F using event delegate in C#.
1)   Create a class to pass as an argument for the event handlers (EventArgs class)
    Solution: TempExceededEventArgs.cs
2)   Set up the delegate for the event
    Solution: TempExceededEventArgs.cs
3)   Declare the code for the event
    Solution: TemperatureSensor.cs
4)   Create code the will be run when the event occurs (Event Handler)
    Solution: TemperatureMonitor.cs
5)   Associate the event with the event handler
    Solution: Program.cs
